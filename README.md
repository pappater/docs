# Some introduction 

Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Pratheesh. I have 8 years of experience in IT, with 5 years focusing on React.js and other frontend technologies. Previously, I worked at Infosys, and today I'm excited to join TCS. My skill set includes React, JavaScript, and various frontend frameworks, and I enjoy working on projects that involve creating smooth and user-friendly interfaces. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling, and bike riding. I'm looking forward to collaborating with all of you and contributing to the team.
